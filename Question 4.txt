(b) and (c)

(b) We expect to see the plots increase exponentially. That is
what we see in the above plots. That is because we are constantly testing
are particles to fit.

(c)
What might happen is that it would not correspond to the initial gaussian
distribution we would have liked to plot but instead a standardize plot would
have appeared.

(d)
Formal report:
When implementing this program, we have learned that the number of attempts it
takes to pack the particles increases as the number of particles increases.
According to the final graphs, we se that the number of attempts increase exponentially.
